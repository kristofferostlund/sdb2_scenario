### Questions, sort of

1. Count the numbers that lie in the field [capacity] between (2880.8) and (3326.6) inclusive.

2. (open's) are what percentage of the field [state]?

3. How many values in the 'code' field do not match the format 9!99{9X}XX?

4. How many times does the least common string appear in the field [herb]?

5. Count the numbers that lie in the field [height] between (16) and (29) inclusive.

6. Find the sum of the numbers in field [tonnes] between (7171) and (10478) inclusive.

7. Count the lines where capacity is more than 683.0 *or* height is less than 44?

### Stages

1. Write Python code to answer your questions. The user should be able to enter the file name and the program should then display the answers to your questions. (Preferably only reading the whole file once).
2. The program should then be modified to follow good practice, which means that the program be altered to first be structured using functions (<em>Stage 1</em>) and then later to use classes and objects correctly, (<em>Stage 2</em>) and be well documented.
3. The next development is to make the program work using the GUI (<em>Stage 3</em>) to allow the user to enter the file name and to display the answers.
4. You will select one research topic from a supplied list and
    - Write a summary of your findings and
    - Apply and demonstrate your findings to one of the stages you have been developing.
5. You need to write an evaluation of your achievements.
6. You should demonstrate that the program is correct by the use of unit tests.

### Deliverables

Your submission should have:

* The pages numbered, and a table of contents after the Title Page.
* The title page containing at the very least, the module name, your name, your tutors name and your student number.
* Your source code (annotated) from each stage of your development.
* Evidence of your program running at each stage, with written commentary (<em>that can be hand written</em>)
* Your research report.
* An evaluation of what you have achieved and the problems you found.
* Your work held in a flat binder or plastic sleeve. (Not ring bound)

### Submission
<b>You need to print out and present the following:</b>

* <b>The program code at each stage</b> (Plain command line, using Objects, GUI and tests). This should be annotated, either by the use of comments or by writing by hand on the printouts. If you must use a word processor, please make sure that the program code is in Curier font, reduced in size to 10 pt and has a reasonable small tab size. Each time you move onto the next stage, you need to keep a copy of the original work you have done up to that point. Please put the evidence of the program running immediately after the printout of the program source code, then any testing code and output from the tests.
* <b>Evidence of your program</b> running for each stage you have completed. You should be aware that you do not have to complete all of the stages before moving onto the next - so, you can move on to changing your program to use classes before you have answered all of the questions for instance. Notice that there is a difference between showing a program works and showing a program runs.
* <b>Your research</b>, no more than 500 words, then adding a section explaining how you got it to work in your program if applicable (<em>and the relevant sections of changed program code</em>).
* <b>An evaluation</b> of what you have achieved over the semester.

### Handing in work

Your work needs to be presented to your tutor in 2 forms. A soft copy so that tutors can run your program code if they wish (a zipped up copy of all your programs + your report and any other documents) and your formal submission which would be printed out, presented in a folder or a single plastic envelope and submitted to L105, you will need to print a front sheet before submitting... Please do not use multiple plastic covers or ring binders.

If you are using MSWord or LibreOffice Writer, please use a monospaced font such as Courier or FreeMono for all your Python source code and reduce the font size to remove any word wrap. All program code needs explanation (annotation) this can be in form of comments or be handwritten onto the printouts.

All marking is done on the basis of evidence which means that even if you did work, if it is not submitted, then you did not do it as far as we are concerned. Any work handed in late is automatically capped at 40% (28 marks for the coursework) unless you have a special arrangements agreed or you submit a late submission form with evidence and it is accepted (forms from room L105). Any work handed in more than 2 weeks after the hand-in date will not be marked.
